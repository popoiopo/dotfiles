** Objectives
Within 10 years I would like to accomplish the following, or for a long time I have wanted to ... but I have not come around to do it. You can fill in the step-by-step plan for each of these.
1. Work/career:
2. Relationships/children/family/friends:
3. House (and garden):
4. Sport/exercise:
5. Culture (passive and/or active):
6. Hobbies/time off: 
** Step-by-step plan
1. What do I want to accomplish (what is my objective) Make sure that your objective complies with the (SMARTIES) criteria
2. Which image fits that situation? Make a drawing of yourself in that situation
3. Do I need money to achieve my goal? How much?
4. Which information do I need to be able to formulate my objective more SMART? 
5. Which actions do I have to take to accomplish my goal?  Make a list of steps starting with the last step to reach the goal and then work your way back to the present.
6. What will be the action I am going to take in the next 72 hours? (This will be the first important step in achieving your goal)
7. How will I celebrate when I have succeeded taking a next step?
*** Three key values
